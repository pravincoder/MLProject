## Student Performance Prediction Model

This small end-to-end machine learning project predicts student performance based on various features such as gender, race_ethnicity, parental education level, lunch, test prep course, reading score, and writing score. The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn (sklearn), Flask, XGBoost, CatBoost, dill, Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts student performance based on demographic and academic-related features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about students, including their gender, race_ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test prep course completion, and scores in reading and writing.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
` git clone https://github.com/your-username/MLProject.git `

2. Navigate to the project directory:
` cd MLProject `

3. Install the required packages:
` pip install -r requirements.txt `

4. Explore the data and develop the machine learning model using the provided Jupyter notebook(s) in the `notebook` directory.

5. Once the model is trained, run the Flask web application:
`` cd app
python app.py ``

6. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the web interface for predicting student performance.
